        <h2>ID vs Class</h2>
        <p>Although they have similar functions, they are not the same and do not always share the same purpose. </p>

        <h2>ID's are Unique</H2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                Each element can have only one ID.<br> ID can have an unlimited amount of Styles applied to it. <br> Each page can have only one element with that ID.<br>IDs use “#” in the CSS which can also be used as an identifier for HTML “Jump Links” (hyperlinks). <br>This allows you to jump from one place to another on the same web page and can also be used in creating a well-designed Table of Contents.
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Classes are note Unique</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                You can use the same Class on multiple elements.<br>
                Class naming is case sensitive.<br>
                Classes use a “.” in front of the name in the CSS.<br>
                Each Class can have an unlimited amount of Styles applied to it.<br>
                You can use multiple classes on the same element.<br>
